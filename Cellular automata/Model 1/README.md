# MODEL 1: 2D Fungal Growth Simulation

This model simulates the 2D expansion of fungal growth and how it interacts with tree root systems.  Please note it would be helpful to have read the report before trying to understand these instructions


# USAGE

To use this model, follow these steps:

1.  Run the file in Processing IDE.
2.  Propagate the fungi in the world using the creation rules: press `[space]` to do one cellular automata tick and press `[y]` to do 50 ticks at once.
3.  Once the fungi has sufficiently grown through the world the trimming rules can be used. Press `[r]` to compute the `(i_max,j_max)` values. Then press `[t]` to perform one tick of the trimming rulebase.
4.  Once the trimming has been done fully you can show the trimmed network using `[l]`.
